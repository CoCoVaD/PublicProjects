=== Event-B (Rodin) model validation using Prob

In this section, models written in {eventB} with the help of {rodin} platform are uploaded. The models are exported from rodin in the .eventb format. The {prob} tool in the form of {probcli} command has been used for the validation process (LTL model checking).

The models along with their scenarios are added below.

==== Airport Traffic Controller (ATC)

This model defines an automatic airport controller that aims at controlling the traffic of aircraft on the taxiway and the runway. This model also manages the authorization to access the runway for aircraft willing to take off or to land.

//ATC_Abstract
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/ATC_Abstract.eventb[ATC_Abstract] is an abstract eventB model that focuses on the evolution of the number of aircraft on ground.

==== Car Parking Controller

This model defines a control system that allows cars to access a parking lot. This lot has a capacity of 500 cars. To enter and leave the lot, any car uses the same short road. This road is single lane, two-ways, i.e. cars can enter in the lot or leave it, but not both at the same time.

//CarPark_Abstract
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/CarPark_Abstract.eventb[CarPark_Abstract] is an abstract eventB model that focuses on the evolution of the number of cars in the parking lot.
