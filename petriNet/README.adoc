= Petri Net Models with Tina Toolbox

:tina: https://projects.laas.fr/tina/home.php[Tina Toolbox]

== Models - Verification and Validation

In this section, various models that have been modelled as a part of the Masters course at ISAE Supaero were added. 
The following software were used to model, verify and validate these models:

- {tina} with the in-built Universal Model Checking Tool (LTI).


=== Interpreted Petri Nets Models
In this section, models of Interpreted PetriNets (IPNs) were added along with their respective explanatory comments. 

//Verification: State-Space Analysis; Structural Analysis
Validation: LTL (Linear Temporal Logic). The LTL rules along with their results are given in the table for each model.
//The Stepper SImulator has been used for both Verification and Validation.

https://youtu.be/K44-WDUUwSI/[Here] is the demonstration video of the PetriNets (Model2). In this video, we describe how to download and access the Tina toolbox, as well as demonstrated the Model Validation process using SELT.

==== Basic PetriNet Model

Two processes A and B must communicate with each other to execute its own operations:

- A can start only after B has finished;
- B can start only after A has already started;

//Process A
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/ProcessA.ndr[ProcessA] is the petrinet model of A.
