= Petri Net Models with Tina Toolbox

:tina: https://projects.laas.fr/tina/home.php[Tina Toolbox]

== Models - Verification and Validation

In this section, various models that have been modelled as a part of the Masters course at ISAE Supaero were added. 
The following software were used to model, verify and validate these models:

- {tina} with the in-built Universal Model Checking Tool (LTI).


=== Interpreted Petri Nets Models
In this section, models of Interpreted PetriNets (IPNs) were added along with their respective explanatory comments. 

//Verification: State-Space Analysis; Structural Analysis
Validation: LTL (Linear Temporal Logic). The LTL rules along with their results are given in the table for each model.
//The Stepper SImulator has been used for both Verification and Validation.

https://youtu.be/K44-WDUUwSI/[Here] is the demonstration video of the PetriNets (Model2). In this video, we describe how to download and access the Tina toolbox, as well as demonstrated the Model Validation process using SELT.

==== Basic PetriNet Model

Two processes A and B must communicate with each other to execute its own operations:

- A can start only after B has finished;
- B can start only after A has already started;

//Process A
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/ProcessA.ndr[ProcessA] is the petrinet model of A.

//Process B
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/ProcessB.ndr[Process B] is the petrinet model of B.

//Process AB
ifdef::env-github[]

==== Shopfloor PetriNet Model

This IPN models a robot, which moves a part from various equipment during the drilling and analysis process.

//Drilling Model
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/Drilling.ndr[Drilling] is the petrinet model of the drilling process alone.

//Micrometer Measure Model
ifdef::env-github[]

//ShopFLoor Global Model
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/Shopfloor.ndr[Shopfloor] is the Global PetriNet, where the composition of the above models have been done so that proper communication can be established.

==== Ball Detection Robot

This IPN models a robot, which detects balls while following a set of WayPoints(WP). Once detected and held properly, the robot could deliver the ball at the DeliveryLocation(L).

//Follow waypoint Model
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/WayPointRob.ndr[WayPointRob] is the petrinet model where the robot follows the pre-defined waypoints.

//Ball Detection and Delivery Model
ifdef::env-github[]
link:Models/BallDetRob.ndr[BallDetRob] is the petrinet model of ball detection and delivery.
